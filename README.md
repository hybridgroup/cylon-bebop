# Cylon.js For Bebop

Cylon.js (http://cylonjs.com) is a JavaScript framework for robotics, physical computing and the Internet of Things.

This module provides an adaptor/driver for the [Parrot Bebop](http://www.parrot.com/products/bebop-drone/) drone.

The implementation uses the [`node-bebop`](https://github.com/hybridgroup/node-bebop) node module from [@hybridgroup](https://github.com/hybridgroup).

## How to Install

    $ npm install cylon cylon-bebop

## How to Use

```javascript
var Cylon = require('cylon');

Cylon.robot({
  connections: {
    bebop: { adaptor: 'bebop' }
  },

  devices: {
    drone: { driver: 'bebop' }
  },

  work: function(my) {
    my.drone.takeOff();
    after((5).seconds(), my.drone.land);
  }
}).start();
```

## How to Connect

The Bebop is a WiFi device, and by default it is configured to act as a WiFi access point. To connect to a single drone just connect your computer's WiFi to the drone's WiFi. The default name for the Bebop's access point will include "Bebop" in its name.
